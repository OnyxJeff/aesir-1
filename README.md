**Aesir-1** is my homelab's command center—an Intel NUC running **Proxmox**, managing my container infrastructure via **Portainer**. It powers essential services like:

- `*-darr stack` (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.)
- `netboot.xyz` for PXE booting
- `nginx-proxy-manager` for reverse proxy and SSL management

## 🚀 Deployment

After installing Proxmox on this node this should be installed into a Linux VM or Ubuntu LXC container.

To deploy a stack:

```bash
cd docker/"stack-name"
docker-compose up -d
```
